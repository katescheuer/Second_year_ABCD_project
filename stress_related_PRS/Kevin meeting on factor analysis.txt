Meeting with Kevin to discuss factor analysis (5/7/2024)

Kevin's specific concerns
==========================
- sometimes people use bifactor models without doing the underlying work on defining a construct
- reflective vs formative models
    - reflective models say one things causes others
    - formative models say all these things have some common effect
    - exposome is a formative model so we're not saying there's only underlying factor *causing* exposure to adverse events, environmental toxins, prenatal exposures etc
- bifactor models
    - naturally have a high fitting propensity meaning they fit data better than other comparative factor models
    - good authors for more info: Steeve Reese (first author of exposome paper Moore was student), Dale Kim, Wes Bonifay

Takeaways
==========
- important interpretation note
    - in a bifactor model, the general factor is specifically forced to be independent of the subfactor
    - ie the general exposome score is independent of the six subfactors
    - when put exposome in models, should add general factor and all six subfactors in same model
    - wrong interpretation: subfactors are sub-parts of general exposome score
- look into how specifically exposome score was generated, see if can get code from Ran (esp because may need to remove some measures so don't overal with outcomes)
- maybe talk to Tyler Moore to ask how should think about exposome, what meaning should take away from exposome score
- look into critiques of bifactor models generally and the use of bifactor models with the p factor
- for nrsa aim 2, compare exposome vs just cumulative risk score vs income-to-needs
- important notes on exposome score
    - does not include income or parent education
    - does include some things that may overlap with outcomes eg psychosis scores, mania scores, etc
    

Original notes below
====================
Exposome
- used EFA as dimensional reduction
- 348 environmental variables -> iterative EFA to get to 96 variables with "minimal redundancy"
- estimated EFA solution with those 96 variables using iterated target rotation and got six factors as a solution
- quasi-confirmatory bifactor analysis
    - quasi because no cross-validation
    - confirmatory because used to estimate model for score creation rather than to confirm theoretical/empirically-derived model
    - included only 65 of 96 variables because items with an absolute value of association less than 0.30 were removed
    - produced general exposome score and exposome score for six orthogonal subfactors
- see supp methods for: specific steps, paragraph on why bifactor, paragraph on why efa and cfa, etc


What should I know if I want to do my own version of this (to include additional parameters, ie did not include income or parental education, want to include items added for year 4)?


kevin's specific concerns
danger: using bifactor models without doing underlying work on what is this construct
bifactor: high fitting propensity - fits data better than other comparative factor models (steve reese and dale kim, west bonifay)
reflective models - one things causes others
formative model - exposome, adi etc, summary score because think they have some common effect

takeaways:
1. make sure to ask how ran is getting score - get github
2. nrsa - compare exposome vs cumulative risk score vs income
3. look into critiques of bifactor models and p factors


in a bifactor model the general factor is specifically forced to be 
independent of the subfactor


maybe talk to tyler moore - how should i think about this?
what meaning should we take from this?
