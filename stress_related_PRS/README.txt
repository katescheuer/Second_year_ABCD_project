Stress prefix = using allele from paper
Alt_allele prefix = using allele from ABCD
_w_MHC suffix = including MHC with all sig SNPs
_w_one_MHC suffix = including MHC but only one most sig SNP
no suffix = not including MHC

stress_related_SNP.bim = full list of SNPs from original paper
stress_related_SNP_one_MHC.bim = of 11 SNPs in MHC only keeps one SNP with largest effect size
