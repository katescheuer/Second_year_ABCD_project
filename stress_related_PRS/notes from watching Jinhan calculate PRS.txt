supp table 1 - 78 snps, with alt, use weight (beta) bc same as logFC

scp: sends files from local machine to clone

plink: downloaded in klone as set of packages

b files: bim bam
bim = all snps, abcd provides 
unpackage vcf into bim (all snps collected0, bed 9EVERY INDIVIDUAL'S GENOTYPE 10101 for whether have snp or not
fam has every subject id, esx, phenotype (-9 = unknown) so ignore phenotype

renamed_sc_ABCD_imputer: preprocessing, exclude region with many differences

make sure in right dir (instead of [out dir])
mkdir output (within data directory)
now tgo to output directorymake sure all files there (bim)
use --score command 

1 = snp id
2 = alt (or ref) allele
3 = es

--out nameofoutputdir


11 snps not collected by ABCD

alt allele from data is same as ref allele in abcd
maybe bc logfc is effect size for allele list alt allele according to paper

**use ones named stress
