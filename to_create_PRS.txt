To create PRS:

1. Open WSL (penguin)
2. log into the Klone: ssh [NET ID]@klone.hyak.uw.edu
3. ls [figure out where I am]
4. cd /mmfs1/gscratch/forsyth/data/ABCD/

[go to directory that has the stress snp stuff - should be in Stress directory]

/mmfs1/gscratch/forsyth/data/ABCD/Package_1203714_Genetics/genomics_sample03/Stress_KS

5. head stress_related_SNP.bim [make sure this is the right file with snp id as column a, alt or ref allele as column b, effect size as column c]
6. run the command to generate PRS

 /gscratch/forsyth/packages/plink --bfile /gscratch/forsyth/data/ABCD/Package_1203714_Genetics/genomics_sample03/ABCD_Pathways/subset_trios/renamed_scz_ABCD_imputed --score /gscratch/forsyth/data/ABCD/Package_1203714_Genetics/genomics_sample03/Stress_KS/data/cd  1 2 3 sum --out /gscratch/forsyth/data/ABCD/Package_1203714_Genetics/genomics_sample03/Stress_KS/output/StressPRS_w_MHC

note: need to specify absolute path in output part or cd to directory where want output
\
 1. copy files 
 scp [origin_file_path] [desination_file_path]
 Anything on Klone, add prefix:
 kscheuer@klone.hyak.uw.edu:
 2. copy directories
 scp -r  [origin_file_path] [desination_file_path]


 1. use ls a lot
 2. pwd a lot
 3. check the folder you're in
 4. check what directory you're in
 5. check what directory is output and if anythign else is there
 6. when testing commands and things try in ubuntu on local machine first then on klone
 7. explorer.exe . will open normal explorer, can drag/drop to home machine

 chmod -R 777 [thedirectoryname] to grant permission

 if I need more resources: 
 salloc -A forsyth -p compute-bigmem -N 1 -c 10 --mem=50G --time=03:00:00
 - Note: -c = CPU you want, --mem is memory, -p choose from compute/compute-bigmem

 Checking job status:
 squeue -u kscheuer
 Checking who are using the resources currently
 squeue -A forsyth
